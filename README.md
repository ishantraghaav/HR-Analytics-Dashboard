# HR-Analytics-Dashboard

The HR department of a company sought a comprehensive solution to track and analyze key HR metrics such as employee performance, retention, and diversity. I have analyzed the HR data and developed an interactive dashboard using Power BI to meet this requirement. This dashboard provides HR professionals with actionable insights into workforce demographics, employee engagement, and overall performance, allowing for strategic decision-making to enhance employee retention and satisfaction.
